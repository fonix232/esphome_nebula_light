# Nebula Light
## Credits go to:
Based on the idea of [3ative - How-to make a 'Galaxy Projector LED Nebula Light' smart and work with Home Assistant](https://youtu.be/YwHWbcuztuY).

## Differences
3ative uses the "dumb" nebula light. Meaning no wifi, no tuya integration, contolling the light is done by using a regular IR remote control. 

I am using the smart version of the nebula light, which includes the use of the Tuya IOT platform. 

## Why go through all the trouble!?
I am not a big fan of cheap and "smart" devices living inside my network. They are a potential security risk as security is not a big priority for companies like Tuya. 

That is why I wanted to flash ESPhome on the device and be sure I have full control of the code running on the nebula light. And so the story begins...

## Tuya WB3S 
Unfortunately Tuya switched from a regular ESP8266 chip to another chip, designed by Tuya itself, called WB3S:
 
![Tuya WB3S][img1]

The pin out of the device is exactly the same as a ESP12:
![Tuya and ESP12][img2]

Swapping the WB3S with an ESP12 is straight forward:
- Gently remove the Tuya chip using hot air gun or solder station
- Remove remaining solder and clean PCB using some alcohol
- solder ESP12 on the PCB
- Add resistor between pin GPIO15 and GND to force the ESP12 in normal boot mode. Any resistor between 2K to 10K will do the job.

## Detailed description:
First you will need to open the case by removing four screws on the side of the device. After that you will be able to open the device by removing the top part of the case:
![Opening the device][img3]

Remove the 3 screws that hold the PCB in place and disconnect the cables running to  the RGB led, laser, motor and the button.

Next remove the PCB from the case.

![PCB back][img5]

Remove the Tuya WB3S chip with your prefered way. I personaly used a hot air gun. Once the WB3S is removed, remove any excess solder and clean the PCB with some alcohol.

Flash ESP12 module with code [below](##ESPHome-config) 
I used a ESP8266 burner for this.

Solder the ESP12 into place and add a resistor between GPIO15 and GND

Now you can test the ESP12 by connecting all wires

If all works, put the case back together and enjoy you ESPHome enabled nebula light!

## ESPHome config
For some reason, and I don't know why, if the motor is stopped the brightness of the laser is effected. By powering the motor at very low power (15 percent) the brightness of the laser is consistant and will not rotate the laser or RBG led.
